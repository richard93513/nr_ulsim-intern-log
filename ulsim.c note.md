## üîß 3.1 Transport Block Generation
- Calculates the appropriate TB size based on MCS, bandwidth, and other configuration.

- Generates a pseudo-random bit sequence to simulate real uplink data.

- Appends CRC for error detection before encoding.

```c
ulsch->harq_processes[harq_pid]->TBS = nr_compute_tbs(
  pusch_pdu->mcs,
  pusch_pdu->mcs_table,
  pusch_pdu->nb_layers,
  pusch_pdu->rb_size,
  pusch_pdu->nr_of_symbols,
  pusch_pdu->dmrs_symbol_map,
  pusch_pdu->nr_of_dmrs_symbols,
  0,  // tb_scaling
  pusch_pdu->transform_precoding
);
```
- Computes the Transport Block Size (TBS) using 3GPP-defined tables based on modulation scheme, number of layers, and resource allocation.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < TBS_bytes; i++)
  ulsch_input_buffer[i] = (unsigned char)(taus() & 0xff);
```
- Fills the input buffer with random bits using a seeded Tausworthe generator to ensure reproducibility.

```c
ulsch_input_buffer[TBS_bytes] = 0;
ulsch_input_buffer[TBS_bytes+1] = 0;
ulsch_input_buffer[TBS_bytes+2] = 0;
ulsch_input_buffer[TBS_bytes+3] = 0;
```
- Reserves space for the 24-bit CRC at the end of the transport block.

```c
crc = crc24a(ulsch_input_buffer, TBS_bytes);
ulsch_input_buffer[TBS_bytes]     = (uint8_t)((crc>>24)&0xff);
ulsch_input_buffer[TBS_bytes + 1] = (uint8_t)((crc>>16)&0xff);
ulsch_input_buffer[TBS_bytes + 2] = (uint8_t)((crc>>8 )&0xff);
ulsch_input_buffer[TBS_bytes + 3] = (uint8_t)((crc    )&0xff);
```
- Computes and appends the CRC to the transport block to enable error checking at the receiver.

## üîß 3.2 LDPC Encoding & Rate Matching
- Encodes the Transport Block using LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) coding.

- Applies segmentation and filler bit insertion if the TB is too large.

- Performs rate matching to match codeword length with the physical layer budget.

```c
nr_ulsch_encoding(gNB->ulsch[UE_id],
                  &gNB->frame_parms,
                  NULL,
                  &gNB->UL_req,
                  pusch_pdu,
                  ulsch_input_buffer,
                  0, // no SRS
                  0);
```

  - CRC segmentation if TB > 8424 bits.

  - LDPC base graph selection based on TB size and code rate.

  - LDPC encoding using parity-check matrices.

  - Filler bit insertion if necessary.

  - Rate matching (puncturing or repetition) to adjust output length.

```c
ulsch->harq_processes[harq_pid]->F = number_of_filler_bits;
```
- Filler bits (F) are set when TBS is not a multiple of the LDPC lifting size. These bits are ignored during decoding.

## üîß 3.3 Transport Block CRC & LDPC Encoding

- Adds CRC to the Transport Block (TB) for error detection.
- Selects LDPC base graph and encoding parameters based on TB size and MCS.
- Encodes the TB using LDPC encoder and performs rate matching.

```c
nr_generate_dci(...);  // optional for DCI-based setups
crc = crc24a(tinput, tb_size_bits);
nr_segmentation(tinput, ...); // Segments TB if size > 8424 bits
The internal flow of nr_ulsch_encoding() includes:
```

- CRC segmentation if TB > 8424 bits.

- LDPC base graph selection based on TB size and code rate.

- LDPC encoding using parity-check matrices.

- Filler bit insertion if necessary.

- Rate matching (puncturing or repetition) to adjust output length.

```c
nr_ulsch_encoding(...)  // Full LDPC encode + rate matching
```
- Output is a modifiable codeword buffer used for modulation in next step.

## üîß 3.4 Modulation & DMRS Insertion

- Maps the encoded bits into modulation symbols (QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, etc.).
- Inserts Demodulation Reference Signals (DMRS) into the resource grid.
- Prepares full transmission grid combining data and reference symbols.

```c
nr_modulation(codeword, ...);
```
- Converts the codeword into complex modulation symbols based on the modulation order.

```c
nr_generate_dmrs_pusch(...);
```
- Generates DMRS symbols used for channel estimation at the receiver.
```c
nr_fill_ulsch(...)  // Assembles modulated data and DMRS into resource grid
```
- The final output of this stage is a sequence of time-domain samples ready for OFDM processing and transmission.

## üîß 3.5 Channel Transmission (AWGN/Fading)

- Transmits the modulated signal through a simulated channel.
- Supports different models like AWGN or TDL-A/B/C fading.
- Adds noise or multipath effects to the transmitted signal.

```c
if (channel_model == AWGN) {
  add_awgn_noise(txdata, SNR_dB, ...);
}
```
- Adds Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) based on target SNR.

```c
if (UE2gNB != NULL) {
  multipath_channel(txdata, rxdata, UE2gNB, ...);
}
```
- Applies fading and multipath channel effects using pre-defined models.

- This stage simulates real-world transmission impairments, preparing the signal for receiver processing.

## üîß 3.6 Receiver Processing and LLR Computation

- The received signal undergoes demodulation and channel estimation.
- Computes Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) for each received bit.
- These LLRs are used in the LDPC decoder.

```c
nr_ulsch_channel_estimation(rxdata, ...);
```
- Estimates the channel from DMRS symbols, needed to equalize received data.

```c
nr_ulsch_extract_rbs(rxdataF, &ulsch_llr, ...);
```
- Extracts resource blocks from the received data for decoding.

```c
nr_ulsch_llr_computation(rxdataF, ulsch_llr, ...);
```
- Performs LLR computation based on modulation type and channel estimate.

- This step is critical for decoding accuracy and ultimately affects BLER performance.

## üîß 3.7 Decoding & Error Checking

- Applies LDPC decoding to the received LLRs using the base graph and decoding algorithm.
- Checks the integrity of the decoded transport block via CRC verification.
- Determines whether the decoding was successful or needs retransmission.

```c
ret = nr_ulsch_decoding(
  UE,
  SNR,
  gNB_id,
  UE_id,
  harq_pid,
  llr,
  &TBS,
  frame,
  nr_tti_rx,
  0,
  get_Qm_ul(pusch_pdu->mcs),
  N_RB_UL,
  NULL
);
```

ul_total++;
```

```c
if (ret < 0) {
    ul_errors++;
    if (ulsch->max_ldpc_iterations == max_ldpc_iterations)
      crc_errors++;
    else
      decoder_errors++;
}
```
- Checks whether LDPC decoding failed (ret < 0).

- Increments ul_errors.

- Distinguishes between decoding errors (decoder_errors) and final CRC errors (crc_errors).

```c
if (ulsch->last_iteration_cnt == max_ldpc_iterations)
    decoder_max_it++;
```
- Tracks how many decoding attempts reached the maximum number of iterations.

```c
if (tb_crc_failed) {
    false_positive++;
}
```
- Records "false positives" ‚Äî cases where decoding passed but CRC failed.

```c
if (ul_errors > 0 && ret >= 0)
    errors_scrambling += estimate_scrambling_errors(decoded_bits, original_bits);
```
- Optionally estimates bit errors due to incorrect scrambling.
