# Uplink Simulation
## ulsim.c

---

## File Path
**openair1/SIMULATION/NR_PHY/ulsim.c**  
OAI uplink physical layer simulation entry point. Simulates uplink transmission and decoding without over-the-air RF hardware.

---

## Initialization and Flow Overview

# üß† NR Uplink Simulator: Main Flow Structure Notes

This document serves as a structural note for the `nr_ulsim.c` simulation main program.  
It divides the program into **three major sections** and provides a detailed breakdown  
of the **Startup & Initialization** phase.  

This corresponds to the physical layer (PHY) simulation logic in **OpenAirInterface (OAI)**.

![Editor _ Mermaid Chart-2025-06-25-163830](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebd60712-c057-498c-a0e1-4d59de972d83)

The program is divided into the following three main parts:

1. **Program Startup & CLI Parsing**
   - Entry point: `main()`
   - Parses command-line arguments (e.g., SNR, MCS, number of trials).
   - Sets global simulation parameters.

2. **Simulation Initialization**
   - Initializes system configuration, memory buffers, and channel models.
   - Sets up modulation, frame structure, and UE/gNB parameters.

3. **Main Simulation Loop (`n_trials`)**
   - Runs the full uplink PHY transmission and reception chain.
   - Includes transport block generation, encoding, modulation, channel transmission, decoding, and error checking.

## 1. Program Startup & CLI Parsing

This section handles program startup and command-line interface (CLI) option parsing. It sets up initial simulation parameters and prepares the program to run the uplink simulation.

### 1.1 Command-Line Argument Parsing

- Uses `getopt` to parse CLI options like SNR range, number of trials, MCS, etc.
- Validates input parameters and stores them in global or local variables.

### 1.2 Global Parameter Setup

- Loads or initializes global parameters related to the NR frame structure.
- Sets values for bandwidth, subcarrier spacing, number of resource blocks, etc.

### 1.3 Logging and Output Setup

- Configures logging levels and output file handles.
- Prepares CSV files or other output formats if requested.

### 1.4 Memory Allocation

- Allocates buffers for transmitted and received data.
- Prepares data structures needed throughout the simulation.

### 1.5 Initial Checks and Messages

- Prints summary of simulation configuration.
- Verifies correctness of parameters before entering main loop.

  // When input file is provided, read simulation parameters and data from file.
  // Useful for replay or predefined scenarios.
  read_input_file(input_fd, &sim_params);
}
