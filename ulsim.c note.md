## 3. Main Simulation Loop (n_trials)

- Appends CRC for error detection before encoding.

```c

  pusch_pdu->mcs_table,
  pusch_pdu->nb_layers,
  pusch_pdu->rb_size,

ulsch_input_buffer[TBS_bytes + 3] = (uint8_t)((crc    )&0xff);
```
- Computes and appends the CRC to the transport block to enable error checking at the receiver.
