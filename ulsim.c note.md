# Uplink Simulation
## ulsim.c

---

## File Path
**openair1/SIMULATION/NR_PHY/ulsim.c**  
OAI uplink physical layer simulation entry point. Simulates uplink transmission and decoding without over-the-air RF hardware.

---

## Initialization and Flow Overview

### General
`nr_ulsim` is a command-line simulation tool for testing 5G NR uplink PHY procedures. It bypasses RF front-end transmission and directly tests encoding, modulation, channel, and decoding within one process.

# nr_ulsim Simulation Flow (OpenAirInterface)

## Overview

This document describes the overall process and internal modules involved in the `nr_ulsim` uplink physical layer simulator of the OAI project.

## üîç Module Descriptions

### 1. Program Startup and Parameter Parsing

- Execution starts from `main()`.
- Parses CLI options using `getopt` (e.g., SNR range, MCS, number of trials).
- Loads and sets global parameters for simulation.

---

### 2. Simulation Environment Initialization

- Initializes random seeds and sin-cos LUTs.
- Configures the channel model (AWGN, TDL-A/B/C).
- Sets up modulation, resource block settings, HARQ parameters.

---

### 3. Simulation Loop (`n_trials`)

- Generates a new Transport Block (TB).
- Appends CRC for error detection.
- Performs LDPC encoding to produce the codeword.
- Applies rate matching and interleaving.
- Modulates symbols (QPSK/16QAM/64QAM).
- Adds DMRS (reference signals for channel estimation).
- Passes data through the simulated channel (AWGN or fading).
  
---

### 4. Receiver Processing

- Demodulates the received signal and computes Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).
- Performs LDPC decoding to retrieve the original data.
- Verifies the decoded result using CRC.
- Uses HARQ logic to determine if retransmission is required.

---

### 5. Performance Statistics

- Collects simulation metrics: Block Error Rate (BLER), throughput, delay, etc.
- Determines if the configured number of trials has been completed.
- If not, continues the simulation loop.

---

### 6. Finalization

- Prints or saves final results (e.g., to CSV file).
- Frees all allocated memory and gracefully exits the simulation.

# üß† NR Uplink Simulator: Main Flow Structure Notes

This document serves as a structural note for the `nr_ulsim.c` simulation main program.  
It divides the program into **three major sections** and provides a detailed breakdown  
of the **Startup & Initialization** phase.  

This corresponds to the physical layer (PHY) simulation logic in **OpenAirInterface (OAI)**.

![Editor _ Mermaid Chart-2025-06-25-163830](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebd60712-c057-498c-a0e1-4d59de972d83)

The program is divided into the following three main parts:

1. **Program Startup & CLI Parsing**
   - Entry point: `main()`
   - Parses command-line arguments (e.g., SNR, MCS, number of trials).
   - Sets global simulation parameters.

2. **Simulation Initialization**
   - Initializes system configuration, memory buffers, and channel models.
   - Sets up modulation, frame structure, and UE/gNB parameters.

3. **Main Simulation Loop (`n_trials`)**
   - Runs the full uplink PHY transmission and reception chain.
   - Includes transport block generation, encoding, modulation, channel transmission, decoding, and error checking.

## üîß 1. Program Startup & CLI Parsing (Part 1)

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv)
```
- Entry point of the simulation.
- Receives command-line arguments for configuration.

```c
init_openair0();
```
- Initializes the RF frontend abstraction (though unused in pure simulation).

```c
randominit(0);
set_taus_seed(0);
```
- Seeds random number generators for reproducibility.

## üîß 1. Program Startup & CLI Parsing (Part 2)

```c
load_configmodule(argc, argv);
```
- Loads and parses configuration modules (usually for global OAI params).

```c
logInit();
```
- Initializes the logging system.

```c
set_glog(LOG_DEBUG, LOG_HIGH, 1);
```
- Sets global log verbosity level.

```c
int ret = 1;
```
- Default return value, will be set to 0 if simulation completes successfully.

```c
cpu_set_t cpuset;
```
- Declares CPU affinity set for potential multi-core execution binding.

## üîß 1. Program Startup & CLI Parsing (Part 3)

```c
init_openair0();
```
- Initializes RF hardware interface abstraction (even if unused in simulation mode).

```c
randominit(0);
```
- Initializes the random number generator with seed 0.

```c
crcTableInit();
```
- Initializes the CRC table used in encoding/decoding.

```c
generate_ul_reference_signal_sequences();
```
- Generates reference signal sequences (e.g., DMRS) for uplink.

```c
init_context(gNB, UE, &gNB_config, &UE_config);
```
- Sets up the gNB and UE context structures with simulation parameters.

## üîß 1. Program Startup & CLI Parsing (Part 4)

```c
if (input_fd) {
  // When input file is provided, read simulation parameters and data from file.
  // Useful for replay or predefined scenarios.
  read_input_file(input_fd, &sim_params);
}```
- Handles optional input from a file to override or provide simulation parameters.

```c
if (output_fd) {
  // Opens file for writing simulation output results.
  open_output_file(output_fd);
}```
- Prepares output destination for simulation logs or data.

```c
if (scg_fd) {
  // Reads secondary cell group configuration if provided.
  read_scg_config(scg_fd);
}```
- Loads additional configuration for simulation (optional).
