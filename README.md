# NR ULSIM Intern Log

This repository contains documentation and simulation logs related to the `nr_ulsim` component of OpenAirInterface (OAI). The goal is to document the structure, functionality, and testing of the NR uplink simulator.

## Structure

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `ulsim.c note.md` | Analysis and explanation of `nr_ulsim.c` source code |
| `simulation_test/parameter-settings.md` | Description of command-line simulation parameters |
| `simulation_test/run-log.md` | Actual command-line logs and output |
| `simulation_test/results-blersnr.md` | Result analysis (e.g., BLER vs SNR) |
| `daily-log.md` | Day-by-day work record |

## Notes

- This repo focuses only on the uplink simulation tool (`nr_ulsim`).
- Other layers (e.g., MAC/RLC) are not covered.
